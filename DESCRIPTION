Description: The package is used to estimate the power to reject the Null Hypothesis in a Likelihood Ratio Test for two nested models fit using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The function requires as input desired alpha (`alpha`; default = 0.05), the non-centrality parameter (`diffLL`), i.e., the difference in the log-likelihood of the two models), and the difference in the degrees of freedom in the two models (`diffDF`).
